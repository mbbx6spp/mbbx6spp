#+TITLE: Post-postmodern software engineer & engineering leader

Hi, I am =mbbx6spp= on GitHub.

I specialize in growing high-performance small software engineering
teams and migrating hard-to-maintain legacy systems in to continuously
delivered maintainable software.

I love well-typed functional programming to build out infrastructure
and system configuration (Nix/NixOS), backend services (Haskell, Scala),
and frontend applications (PureScript).

In my spare time, I read about economics, psychology, and abstract algebra.
